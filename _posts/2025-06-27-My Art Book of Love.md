The book 'My Art Book of Love' with words by Shana Gozansky, published in 2018 by Phaidon, is the subject of this post.

## The book

This book answers the question how love can look in different paintings and works of art. While it is aimed at children, it can still be enjoyed by adults, too.

It can be ordered with the EAN 9780714877181 in local bookshops.


## The impact

Different chapters explore the essence of love, how love looks, how it feels, what it makes you do, where it can be found and more.

These questions are answered with fine art combined with what they signify, thus allowing readers to find out if they share those impressions of love or if they differ.

The book helps to renew appreciation for art and the way it conveys feelings as well as learning more about ones own perspective on love.


## The conclusion

This is a lovely children's book that can be read and enjoyed by adults as well, because firstly the question what love is can be answered in different ways throughout life and might well be revisited from time to time. Secondly, the art used as answer to this question can inspire on its own and open up new understandings as well as just being beautiful.
