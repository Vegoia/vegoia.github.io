The instructive book "Furoshiki and the Japanese Art of Gift Wrapping" from Tokoko Kakita released in 2021 by Laurence King Publishing is the subject of this post.


## The book

The book explains different ways to wrap gifts and other items in pretty fabric. It features a short introductory explanation of the history and usage of Furoshiki and thirty illustrated wrapping styles.

It can be ordered with the EAN 9781913947651 in local bookshops.


## The impact

The book inspires to (re-)use fabric instead of paper, thus reducing waste and improving sustainability. It is interesting to learn about other gift wrapping options and the history of Furoshiki, but the most exciting part is using the wrapping styles to lovingly wrap gifts or bento boxes or to just miraculously have an emergency bag.


## The conclusion

The fabrics that are used to wrap gifts can be gifted back and forth for years, adding to a gifting tradition and creating a bit of nostalgia at the same time. The book can be a lovely gift itself, but using it oneself is a lot of fun as well.
