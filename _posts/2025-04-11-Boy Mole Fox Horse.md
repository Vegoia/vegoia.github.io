The book 'The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse. The Animated Story' by Charlie Mackery, published in 2022 by Ebury Press, is the subject of this post.

## The book

This book is the book of the film of the book - it uses the animations that were created when making the original book into a film and thus has a different preface explaining this story. Readers are greeted with beautiful writing and the statement of the author that the reader is hopefully ok, where ever they are. 
When you are reading the book the first time, I would recommend skipping this part and only reading it after finishing the book, because it already introduces the characters.

The pictures and the writing are very pretty and the story unfolds in a nice pace, while the open pages leave plenty of room for one's own thoughts and emotions.

It can be ordered with the EAN 9781529197686 in local bookshops.


## The impact

More than telling a straight story this book is about how we treat each other and about how we view ourselves. It shows compassion and gentleness and the value of friendships and love and does that well.


## The conclusion

If you are looking for a book that explains everything and leaves no open spaces, this book is not the one for you. 

If you want to be inspired and think about what is important to you in life, admire pretty pictures and a lovely font as well as see characters treat each other with kindness, empathy and acceptance, maybe give it a read.
