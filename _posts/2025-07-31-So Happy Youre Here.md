The comic book 'I'm So Happy You're Here' by Liz Climo, published in 2022 by HarperCollinsPublishers, is the subject of this post.

## The book

This book shows in great detail and with lots of warmth why the reader is wonderful and why the person gifting this book (or in the first place, the author Liz Climo) is happy they are there. 

It can be ordered with the EAN 9780008520854 in local bookshops.


## The impact

Cute and colourful drawings of animals amplify the short texts directly addressed to the reader that go through a charming explanation of why the reader is great and why self doubt doesn't have to always be taken so seriously. 

The book takes the air out of insecurities and supports a positive image of the reader - it thus helps appreciate not only the wonderful people in our lives, but also the good things about ourselves.

The rhymes and drawings go exceptionally well together and carry the message of appreciation, perseverance and self esteem through the whole book.


## The conclusion

This book helps to see the broader picture when there are difficulties in life and sends a strong message of us deserving the same kindness that we send out into the world.

It can be a pick-me-up in difficult situations or just a bit of sunshine in day to day life, in any way I think it helps being kinder to oneself and in showing appreciation for the wonderful people around us and the lovely situations we can find ourselves in even after hard times.
