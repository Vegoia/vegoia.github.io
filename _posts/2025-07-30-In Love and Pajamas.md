The book 'In Love and Pajamas' by Catana Chetwynd, published in 2021 by Andrews McMeel Publishing, is the subject of this post.

## The book

This book looks into love in the day to day life: Different kinds of hugs, shared experiences, holding hands as well as holding each other.

The printed book itself isn't the nicest quality, because the glue has a strong scent, but the comics make up for that.

It can be ordered with the EAN 9781524864712 in local bookshops.


## The impact

The comics in this book show the little moments of love in everyday life and how John and Catana appreciate each other.

Even though it is their life and stories that are portrayed, they are very relatable and when reading it with a partner it is easy and cute and pleasant to find similarities and differences in how we show our love for each other. 


## The conclusion

This collection of comics makes the reader look into how they show their love and helps to appreciate love in every day situations. It makes them want to try different hugs and build forts on the couch and take naps together. 

This makes it a great book to give to a partner or to just enjoy reading together.
