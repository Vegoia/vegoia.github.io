## The book

## The impact

This novel is sweet and calm and cosy as well as having exciting and peculiar and whimsical moments. The desire to live a slower life filled with peace and surrounded by warm-hearted people shines through the whole book and makes the reader take a breath and consider what might be more important than being the strongest swordswoman or the mightiest warrior.


## The conclusion

Perfect for a cosy winter read, cuddled up under the blankets with a lovely cup of hot drink of choice -- and trying to replicate the recipes afterwards.
