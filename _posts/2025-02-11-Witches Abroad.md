The discworld novel "Witches Abroad" written by Terry Pratchett and published in 1992 with Corgi Books, first published in 1991 with Gollancz, is the subject of this post.

## The book

This book returns to the discworld witches and follows them on their journey to foreign lands, where they have to fight the power of stories.

This edition (EAN 9780552134651) might be harder to order, but there are newer editions as well as the translated versions ready to be ordered in local bookshops. It might also be possible to find this second hand in good condition, as the discworld books have many fans.


## The impact

This novel can be enjoyed on different levels as is the case with all discworld books. In this one we don't only have the plain level of the witches adventures and the level that relates to our world, but additionally the meta level of a story about stories and their power. 
The beautiful thing is that it can be enjoyed on either of these levels alone or combining all of them, making it a tempting read for many people. 
The characters are amazing, the footnotes hilarious and the book had me laugh tears several times.


## The conclusion

Years after reading it the first time (in 2014) I read the novel again and enjoyed it tremendously. A bit of discworld knowledge probably helps in not getting overwhelmed by all the details, but it can also serve as an entry point into some of the leading forces on the discworld. Highly recommended.
