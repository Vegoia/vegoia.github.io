The 'Emily Wilde' book series written by Heather Fawcett and published by Little, Brown Book Group is the subject of this post. 

The first book of the series, 'Emily Wilde's Encyclopaedia of Faeries', was published in paperback in 2023, while the second one, titled 'Emily Wilde’s Map of the Otherlands', was published in 2024 under the EAN 97803565191800 and the third, 'Emily Wilde's Compendium of Lost Tales' was published in 2025 under the EAN 9780356519203.


## The book

This book series shows elegantly how academic fantasy can work in a more grown up setting. 

The books gently introduce the main characters and show their tangible development throughout the series whilst also adding new personalities.

The first book of the series can be ordered with the EAN 9780356519142 in local bookshops, the others with the EAN's mentioned above. They are also being published in other languages, e. g. German and French.


## The impact

The characters are strong and colourfully described and the story makes you want to read through the night. 

The challenges that the characters are facing are to be solved more by intellect than by force and the world building in connecting the world of the Belle Époque with ideas from the realms of fairies and much older stories works really well.


## The conclusion

This book series is a wonderful way to get back into reading fantasy as an adult, if you haven't read fantasy for a while and offers a great option to have a bit of escapism. 

While the books do have their dark moments, I really enjoyed not having to worry about extensive violence like it is the case with other fantasy books.

The books feel cosy and engaging and offer an exciting world to get pulled into.
