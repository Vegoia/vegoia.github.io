The collection of stories in Bolu Babalola's book "Love in Colour" published in 2020 by Headline Publishing Group are the subject of this post.

## The book

The book contains multiple stories that offer a fresh view on old myths engaging with the subject of love. It starts with ten stories referring to old myths, followed by three new tales. The length of the stories varies, but most of them are around twenty pages long, which makes it very easy to pick the book up again and jump right in after life interfering with the read.

It can be ordered with the EAN 9781472268884 in local bookshops.


## The impact

This book can make the reader reconsider their own perspectives, be a joyful pastime or promote own research into the myths and figures that are mentioned. It shows that love doesn't have to mean heartache and drama (although it might mean that as well) and that the definition of love very much depends on the individuals being in love with each other. Some things should obviously always be counted into the mix, consent, benevolence and communication being fundamental, but the details can vary from lovers to lovers.

To quote the author: "Love enriches the world we inhabit."


## The conclusion

Highly recommended read, I especially love the strong female characters. 

The language is electrifying, the characters are well rounded and the plots exciting.
