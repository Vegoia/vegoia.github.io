The subject of this post is Rupi Kaur's poetry collection 'milk and honey' first published in English in 2015.

## The book

This collection of poetry is subdivided into four chapters that each have a different focal point.
While it also is available in German (and many other languages) I read it in English and really enjoyed the plays on words. 

It can still be ordered in your local bookshop with the EAN 9781449474256.


## The impact

This poetry makes you feel all the feelings of love and affection and trauma and heartache and despair and gentleness and recovery.
The poems are accompanied by drawings that make the meaning of the words even more striking.

## The conclusion

Highly recommended beautiful poetry, although the reader shouldn't be too faint of heart.
